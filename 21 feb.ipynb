    "Here are a few reasons why Flask may be used in a web scraping project:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Visualization: Flask can be used to create a web interface that displays the scraped data in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format, such as charts, graphs, tables, or maps. This allows users to explore and analyze the data more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Scraping Automation: Flask can be used to create an API endpoint that triggers the web scraping script and returns the scraped data in a structured format. This allows other applications to access the scraped data automatically and integrate it into their own workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "User Interaction: Flask can be used to create a simple user interface that allows users to input search terms or parameters for the web scraping script, and displays the results in real-time. This provides users with more control and flexibility over the scraping process."
