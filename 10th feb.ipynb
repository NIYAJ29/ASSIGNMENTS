    "The different modes of opening a file in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r' (Read Only): This is the default mode. It opens the file for reading, and you can only read the contents of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' (Write Only): This mode opens the file for writing, and any existing data in the file will be overwritten. If the file doesn't exist, a new file with the same name will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' (Append Only): This mode opens the file for writing, but instead of overwriting the existing data, new data is appended to the end of the file. If the file doesn't exist, a new file with the same name will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' (Exclusive Creation): This mode is used to create a new file for writing, but only if the file does not already exist. If the file already exists, an error will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "'b' (Binary Mode): This mode is used to open a binary file, such as an image or audio file. It is often used in conjunction with one of the above modes, like 'rb' (Read Binary), 'wb' (Write Binary), etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "When you open a file, the operating system allocates resources, such as memory and disk space, to the file. These resources are not automatically released when you finish reading or writing the file, and if you don't close the file, these resources will remain occupied until your program terminates.\n",

    "In a large program that opens and manipulates many files, not closing the files can lead to resource exhaustion and other issues, such as data corruption. On the other hand, if you close a file immediately after you have finished using it, the resources used by the file will be freed up and can be used by other parts of your program.\n",
