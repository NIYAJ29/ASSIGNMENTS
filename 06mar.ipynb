    "Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics involves the collection, organization, and presentation of data in a way that provides insight into the characteristics of the data set. It involves the use of measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, range, quartiles, and percentiles.\n",
    "Example: Suppose you want to determine the average height of students in a class. You would collect data on the height of each student, calculate the mean height of the students, and use descriptive statistics to describe the distribution of heights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential Statistics: Inferential statistics involves using a sample to draw conclusions about a larger population. It involves making inferences about the characteristics of a population based on data collected from a sample.\n",
    "Example: Suppose you want to determine the average height of students in a school. It may be impractical to measure the height of every student in the school, so you might take a random sample of students and use inferential statistics to make an estimate of the average height of all the students in the school.\n",

Descriptive statistics are used to provide a clear and concise summary of the data and to identify patterns or trends within the data.
