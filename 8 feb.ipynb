By encapsulating the data and behavior within objects, you can hide the internal details from the user and only expose relevant information.\n",

This protects the data from external access and modification and ensures that the data is tightly coupled with the behavior.\n",

Accessor methods allow you to retrieve the value of an object's private members, while mutator methods allow you to change the value of an object's private members. By using accessor and mutator methods, you can control how external objects can access and modify the data of an object."
