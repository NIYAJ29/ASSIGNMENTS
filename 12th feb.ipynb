    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program, which interrupts the normal flow of the program.\n",

    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, are errors that occur when the Python interpreter is unable to parse or understand the code because it violates the rules of the language. They occur when the syntax of the code is incorrect, such as missing a closing parenthesis or using an incorrect keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter at compile time, before the program is executed, while exceptions are detected at runtime, during the execution of the program. Additionally, syntax errors prevent the program from being executed at all, while exceptions allow the program to run until the error is encountered, at which point the program may halt or continue running depending on how the error is handled."
